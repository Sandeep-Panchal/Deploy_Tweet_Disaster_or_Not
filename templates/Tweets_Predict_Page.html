  <p style = 'font-size:110%'> This page predicts if a tweet/message is announcing disaster or not.</p>
  <p style = 'font-size:110%'> Few examples like if the tweet reads <mark>'bomb blast did not happen'</mark> then it should predict <mark>'not a disaster'</mark> otherwise <mark>'disaster'</mark>. If the tweet reads <mark>'He killed many people'</mark> then it should predict <mark>'disaster'</mark> otherwise <mark>'not a disaster.'</p>
  <p style = 'font-size:110%'> This prediction is based on the machine learning model that I have trained on the data set from the kaggle's competition. Performance of this model is not that great due to lack of data. Performance - <mark>'f1-score'</mark> of the model on an unseen data is <mark>80.0163</mark> and this is not that great.</p>
  <p style = 'font-size:110%'><mark>Note: This is just a simple model done as a self-interest project. Due to low performance of this model, it can predict wrong too. This is 'only' for learning purpose.</mark>
