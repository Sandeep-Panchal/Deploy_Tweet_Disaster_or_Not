This project is to predict if a tweet/message is announcing a disaster or not.

Few examples like if the tweet reads 'bomb blast did not happen' then it should predict 'not a disaster' otherwise 'disaster'. If the tweet reads 'He killed many people' then it should predict 'disaster' otherwise 'not a disaster.'

Prediction of the tweet is based on the machine learning model that I have trained on the data set from the kaggle's competition. Performance of this model is not great due to a lack of data and prediction could be wrong too. Performance - 'f1-score' of this model on an unseen data is 80.0163 and this is not great.

Note: This is just a simple model done as a self-interest project. This is not for any business purpose. This is 'strictly' for a 'learning' purpose.
